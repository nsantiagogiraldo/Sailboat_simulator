# Simulated enviroment for a sailboat navigation control system based on spiking neural networks

This simulation environment is based on the USVSim simulator developed by Paravasi et. al. in [x] and the BindsNet library, presented in [x]. We use USVSim to simulate the physics of the sailboat and its environment, while BindsNet is used to simulate the impulse neural networks (SNN). It can be used to develop and test control and trajectory strategies for autonomous sailboats, as well as to explore how to use SNNs in sailboat control applications.
